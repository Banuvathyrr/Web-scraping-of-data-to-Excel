**Project: Scrape Financial Data from Moneycontrol to Excel**    


**Overview**    
This project involves scraping financial data (e.g., balance sheets, ratios) from the Moneycontrol website into Excel using the "Get Data" feature. We'll manually extract the appropriate data URL using browser Developer Tools and then feed this URL into Excel to automate data retrieval.
